so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have
bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their
hearts the wicked are great drinkers of water as the flood proved once
for all
happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own
way
if people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them
to break them
and afterward many are strong at the broken places but those that will
not break it kills it kills the very good and the very gentle and the
very brave impartially if you are none of these you can be sure it will
kill you too but there will be no special hurry
gatsby believed in the green light
year recedes before us it eluded us then
we will run faster
morning so we beat on
into the past
towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the
last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates
sake i spit my last breath at thee
